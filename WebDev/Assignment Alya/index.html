                A paragraph of placeholder text. We’re using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We’re adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
            </p>

            <p>
                And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there’s none of that here.

            <h1>Alya - Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou </h1>
            <h2>The Icy Charm of Alya: A Tale of Hidden Warmth</h2>
            <h2>From: Alya Hides Her Feelings In Russian</h2>

            <p>
                Alya, whose full name is <strong>Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou</strong>, is a brilliant and graceful high school student
                known for her icy composure and quiet charm. Behind her calm and confident exterior lies
                a warmth she rarely allows others to see — a gentleness that hides behind polite smiles
                and carefully chosen words. Fluent in both Japanese and Russian, she often lets her true
                feelings slip out in Russian, believing no one around her understands them. But fate has
                a way of turning small assumptions into stories of connection.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Every day, she sits by the window — sunlight spilling softly across her silver hair,
                the light catching the edge of her serious blue eyes. She seems distant, untouchable,
                the kind of girl who belongs in a painting rather than a classroom. Yet behind that
                composed presence is someone who laughs quietly to herself, who worries about the smallest
                things, who blushes when someone looks her way for too long. She hides it well, but the
                truth lingers between every word she refuses to say aloud.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Alya’s life is a delicate balance of grace and restraint. She excels in everything she does,
                from her studies to her manner of speech, carrying herself with an elegance that makes her
                the envy of her peers. But perfection can be heavy. Beneath her flawless image lies a girl
                who longs to be understood — not for her achievements or beauty, but for the quiet emotions
                she keeps tucked behind her confident smile.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sometimes, when her guard slips, her voice softens, and Russian words escape her lips like
                a secret melody. It’s her way of confessing without confessing, of saying things her heart
                feels but her pride can’t allow. To most, it sounds foreign and beautiful. To the one who
                understands, it’s a glimpse into the real Alya — the one who loves, hesitates, and dreams
                in a language that feels safer than her own.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Her charm doesn’t lie in grand gestures or loud emotions but in her subtlety. The way she
                turns her head when embarrassed, the faint blush that colors her cheeks, the soft sigh she
                tries to hide when no one’s listening — these are the moments that reveal the truth she’s
                so desperate to conceal. She isn’t a girl built on perfection, but one made human by her
                contradictions — proud, fragile, and heartbreakingly sincere.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For Alya, love isn’t something to shout or chase. It’s something that blooms quietly in the
                heart, growing stronger each time she pretends not to care. She teases, deflects, hides her
                feelings behind playful remarks, but her eyes always tell a different story. Every glance,
                every whispered word, carries more meaning than she’ll ever admit aloud.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There’s a timeless quality to her presence — a reminder that affection doesn’t need to be
                loud to be real. Alya represents the kind of emotion that exists between the lines, in
                half-finished sentences and quiet silences. Her story isn’t one of dramatic confessions,
                but of the gentle, aching beauty of waiting, of feeling, of almost saying what needs to be
                said.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the end, Alya isn’t defined by her coldness but by the warmth she hides. Beneath her
                poise and intellect lies a heart that beats softly, honestly, and with love she can’t quite
                put into words. And maybe that’s what makes her unforgettable — the girl who whispers her
                feelings in another language, hoping someone will understand them anyway.
            </p>
